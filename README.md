# What I did, learnt and thoughts
I didn't have that much ML background going into this competition. Had compeleted a course on anaconda libraries which definitely helped. My solution finished 15th out of 303 participants, on the public leaderboard, waiting for private leaderboard to be released.

Overall I learnt the importance of adjusting your target variable.
I learnt about backward elimination (ultimately not used in solution but kept code commented), I felt given the amount of categorical variables it overfit the data. This competition worked on synthic data which I felt was a good opportunity to remind you to question your data early. I felt I would have been more productive had I reached out more on the forum earlier, this is a good lesson for a real world enviroment where data collected might not be what you expect...at all.
